        #2 Practice a looooot
        #3 Keep reading related information from books, articles or watch related videos on youtube, etc..
        #3 - It's not only about selenium, it's about how people improve them self in IT. Listen to podcasts, audio books.
        testing related podcasts: Joe Colantonio
        book for selenium: only one - Selenium Cookbook 2nd generation
        #1 book for interview preparation: https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850

WebElement - this is how selenium wraps any kind of elements on the page. Represents HTML element.
WebElement - is an interface.
driver find an element by this locator
driver.findElement(By.name("last-name"));
findElement - it's a method, that returns a WebElement object;

tests package - this is where we gonna store all our tests.
utilities - package, for storing reusable methods that will support our tests. For example, we can create a class with that will give us a WebDriver, whenever we need it.
We have 8 locators:
id              <----- <h3 id="smth"></h3> the best locator. Always unique
name            <----- <h3 name="smth"></h3> good locator. Not Always unique, but mostly
tagName         <----- <h3></h3> | h3 is a tag name. not good locator, almost never unique
className      <----- <h3 class="smth"></h3> not good locator, because almost never unique
linkText     <----- ok locator, sometimes unique
partialLinkText <----- same as linkText
xpath
cssSelector
to check if tag name is unique:
//tagname
if you want to check some attribute like name, id, class just put attribute=value pair into square brackets []
[name='password']
If it shows 1 of 1 - locator is unique
If you see button on page, it doesn't always based on <button> tag. Check first what kind of <tag> represents that element
getAttribute("attribute") --> returns attributes value.
For example:
<a class="button secondary radius" href="/logout"><i class="icon-2x icon-signout"> Logout</i></a>
a - tag name
class - attribute
href - attribute
Logout - text
getAttribute("class") --> button secondary radius

    WebElement - any HTML element on the page for Selenium
    Locators, the best locator is an id
        name
        tagName
        linkText
        partialLinkText
        id
        className
        not covered yet: xpath and cssSelector

    to enter the text, we use .sendKeys("text")
    to read the text, we use element.getText()
    to read some attribute, we use .getAttribute("attribute_name")
    What is your locator is wrong? How you gonna find out?
        -you will get - NoSuchElementException
    submit() you can use it, for buttons that have a type="submit". Can be useful when click() method doesn't work (sometimes it happens)
