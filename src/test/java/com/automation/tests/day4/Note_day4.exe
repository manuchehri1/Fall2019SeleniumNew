StaleElementReferenceException: stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document
Interview question: what is StaleElementReferenceException?
StaleElementReferenceException - means that selenium cannot find previously located element. It happens, when you are trying to interact with element after page refresh or navigation
break until 9:04
How to handle it?
- if it occurs, you need to find element again.
try{
    //if it generates exception once in a while,
    //put it into try/catch and try to find element one more time

    driver.findElement(By.id("name")).click()
}catch(StaleElementReferenceException e){

    driver.findElement(By.id("name")).click()
}
what happens if element wasn't found, in case of findElement?
    NoSuchElementException
what happens if elements weren't found, in case of findElements?
    nothing, you will get empty list.
Interview question: how to check if element doesn't exists any more/ just doesn't exist?
check if collection/list is empty
if(driver.findElements(By.id("name")).size() == 0){
    element doesn't exist!
}
You can use findElements method to find 0+ elements
In case of findElement - only 1 element. If there is no element by given locator - NoSuchElementExcetion
######################################################
    findElements() ----- to find lots of elements at once. Returns List<WebElement>
    in case of findElement - you are getting 1 element. If locator is wrong - NoSuchElementException.
    in case of  findElements - you can get 0+ elements. if locator is wrong or element is gone already, you will get empty list.
    all links have <a> tag
    StaleElementReferenceException - selenium cannot use webelement any more. Element is old.
